# UBC-Safewalk-App

This year we are planning to work on UBC SafeWalk App 

Description: Similar to DoorDash/UberEats-esque app where users can request a safewalk via app, and anyone certified/trained to do so can take the “job” at their own leisure. Being a “delivery driver” (i.e. the safewalker) will require that they have all the training and such that is already present. The safewalkee will be able to see a headshot photo of the person that they’re walking with, receive a verification PIN, can live share location with a friend, to ensure absolute safety during the walk. 

This app could extend to other campus safety and health resources. A UBC Safe app exists already, https://security.ubc.ca/home/safety-prevention-resources/ubc-safe-app/, but the UI is very out of date and theSafeWalk functionality above is not implemented so we are making it better!
